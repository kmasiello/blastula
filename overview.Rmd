# High Level Steps

1. Create the email object in R 

  * simple composition with `compose_email()`

2. Jazz it up

  * `add_cta_button()`
  * `add_ggplot()`
  * `add_image()`
  * `add_imgur_image()` 

3. Send the email

  * `smtp_send()` 
  * `attach_connect_email()`

# Spice it up with RStudio Connect

A few ideas to get the ideas flowing 

* Conditional Emails

  * Send an email only if certain criteria are met (e.g., threshold parameter exeeded) 
  * Send different emails depending on conditions 
  * Example: [https://solutions.rstudio.com/examples/blastula/conditional-example](https://solutions.rstudio.com/examples/blastula/conditional-example) 
  
* Include logging information in your ETL document to provide a historical record of _who_ got your email, _when_
